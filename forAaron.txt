look through the structure of everything to get a feeling of how everything is places i, dont know how different its going to be 
for you to get it runnng becasue of file structures what not but try get it to work on your side, probably make a branch for it etc
i put a bunch of ids in the view i thought youd need everything is kinda colour coded so you can see which element is which in 
the css based on the background, 
there is a cookie js that will be accessable throughout and a pagebuilder js with the classes i used to construct the products on products 
use it abuse it to get the data for the view product like just put the data of the product in the constructor and you can access all it holds
