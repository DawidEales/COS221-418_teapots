Appropriate for bi-wirable speaker systems and terminated with high-quality silver-plated banana plugs, AudioQuest Rocket 88 is a high-performance speaker cable resolving enough for most high-end audio systems.

Whenever possible, running separate cables to the treble and bass portions of a bi-wirable loudspeaker significantly reduces distortion. For these applications, an AudioQuest cable like Rocket 88 Bi-Wire keeps the large magnetic fields associated with bass energy out of the treble cable, allowing the delicate upper frequencies to travel a less disturbed path, like taking the waves out of the water when you swim.

      "longDescription": "AudioQuest Rocket 88 Bi-Wire speaker cable is the flagship model of the company&#8217;s versatile Rocket Series. It shares several outstanding design elements with its award-winning siblings, but significantly improves overall performance with its higher-purity conductor metal and patented 72v Dielectric-Bias System. Appropriate for bi-wirable speaker systems and terminated with high-quality silver-plated banana plugs, AudioQuest Rocket 88 is a high-performance speaker cable resolving enough for most high-end audio systems. Rocket 88 uses only AudioQuest&#8217;s very best copper, Solid Perfect-Surface Copper+ (PSC+), in a Double Star-Quad configuration designed to reduce distortion for cleaner, clearer, more naturally detailed sound. Like other models in the Rocket Series, Rocket 88 features AudioQuest&#8217;s effective Carbon-Based Noise-Dissipation, and, as with all AudioQuest cables, the conductors in Rocket 88 are Direction-Controlled to minimize the damaging effects of radio-frequency noise. Taking noise-dissipation even further, Rocket 88 adds AudioQuest&#8217;s patented 72v Dielectric-Bias System (DBS), which minimizes dielectric noise and improves wide-bandwidth dissipation of induced radio-frequency noise. Whenever possible, running separate cables to the treble and bass portions of a bi-wirable loudspeaker significantly reduces distortion. For these applications, an AudioQuest cable like Rocket 88 Bi-Wire keeps the large magnetic fields associated with bass energy out of the treble cable, allowing the delicate upper frequencies to travel a less disturbed path, like taking the waves out of the water when you swim. The result is smoother, clearer, more natural sound. With its thoughtful, time-tested combination of high-quality materials and design elements, AudioQuest Rocket 88 is an outstanding choice for high-performance audio systems.",
