JBL&#8217;s patent-pending Radiation Boundary Integrator&#174;(RBI) technology, adapted from the groundbreaking VERTEC&#8482; Series of line array loudspeakers, delivers consistent coverage of the listening area. Combining a large 200 mm (8 in) diameter waveguide with low-frequency projection apertures, the two coaxially-mounted drivers provide a seamless integration of coverage, resulting in extremely even pattern control and coverage where all listeners hear a consistent, high-fidelity sound quality. The wide 120&#176;coverage pattern allows for the use of fewer speakers, reducing the cost of the installed system without sacrificing performance. The Control 65P/T contains a high-quality 60 Watt multi-tap transformer for use on 70V/100V distributed loudspeaker lines, and is switchable for 8-ohm voice-coil direct operation.",

JBL&#8217;s patent-pending Radiation Boundary Integrator&#174;(RBI) technology, adapted from the groundbreaking VERTEC&#8482; Series of line array loudspeakers, delivers consistent coverage of the listening area. Combining an extra-large 280 mm (11 in) diameter waveguide with low-frequency projection apertures, the two coaxially-mounted drivers provide a seamless integration of coverage, resulting in extremely even pattern control and coverage where all listeners hear a consistent, high-fidelity sound quality. The wide 120&#176;coverage pattern allows for the use of fewer speakers, reducing the cost of the installed system without sacrificing performance. The Control 67P/T contains a high-quality 60 Watt multi-tap transformer for use on 70V/100V distributed loudspeaker lines, and is switchable for 8-ohm voice-coil direct operation.",
